INGREDIENTS:
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
5 cups chicken stock
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
2 teaspoons reduced sodium soy sauce
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1 green onion, thinly sliced
FOR THE CRISPY WONTONS
1 cup vegetable oil
1 (12-ounce) package won ton wrappers, cut into strips
DIRECTIONS:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium high heat. Working in batches, add won ton strips to the Dutch oven and fry until evenly golden brown and crispy, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and 1/4 cup water; set aside.
Heat sesame oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
Stir in garlic and ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in turmeric and pepper.
Stir in chicken stock. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors have blended, about 5-10 minutes.
Stir in cornstarch mixture, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in rice wine vinegar and soy sauce.
Gradually add eggs in a slow steady stream, stirring with a fork. Cook until the eggs are set, stirring frequently to create ribbons, about 2 minutes.
Serve immediately with won ton strips, garnished with green onions, if desired.
